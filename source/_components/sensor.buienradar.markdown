The `buienradar` platform uses [buienradar.nl](http://buienradar.nl/) as an source for current meteorological data for your location. The weather forecast is delivered by Buienradar, who provides a webservice that provides detailed weather information for users in The Netherlands.
The relevant weatherstation used will be automatically selected based on the location specified in the Home Assistant configuration (or in the buienradar weather/sensor component).

To integrate `buienradar` with Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: buienradar
    monitored_conditions:
      - symbol
      - humidity
      - temperature
      - windspeed
      - pressure
```

Configuration variables:

- **name**  (*Optional*): You can specify a name of the component, but do not have to. If you specify a name, the sensors will get an entity name of 'sensor.[name]`[monitored_condition]`, for example: `sensor.lopik_temperature`; if no name is specified the sensors will be called `sensor.br_[monitored_condition]`, for example `sensor.br_temperature`.
- **latitude** (*Optional*): Latitude to use for selection of data source location. Longitude and latitude will be taken from Home Assistant configuration, but can be overridden/changed in this component to select a different location for buienradar.nl.
- **longitude** (*Optional*): Longitude to use for selection of data source location. Longitude and latitude will be taken from Home Assistant configuration, but can be overridden/changed in this component to select a different location for buienradar.nl.
- **timeframe** (*Optional*): Minutes to look ahead for precipitation (5..120) [default: 60].
- **monitored_conditions** array (*Required*): One or more conditions to display in the frontend.
  - **stationname**: The name of the selected meteo-station.
  - **symbol**: A symbol for the current weather.
  - **humidity**: The relative humidity (%).
  - **temperature**: The current temperature (in C).
  - **groundtemperature**: The current ground temperature (in C).
  - **windspeed**: The wind speed in m/s.
  - **windforce**: The wind speed/force in Bft.
  - **winddirection**: Where the wind is coming from in degrees, with true north at 0Â° and progressing clockwise.
  - **windazimuth**: Where the wind is coming from: N (North),Z (south), NO (Noth-East), etc.
  - **pressure**: The sea-level air pressure in hPa.
  - **visibility**: Visibility in meters (m).
  - **windgust**: The windspeed of wind gusts (m/s).
  - **precipitation**: The amount of precipitation/rain in mm/h.
  - **irradiance**: Sun intensity in Watt per square meter (W/m2).
  - **precipitation_forecast_average**: The average expected precipitation/rain in mm/h within the given timeframe.
  - **precipitation_forecast_total**: The total expected precipitation/rain in mm/h within the given timeframe.

Full configuration example where location is manually specified:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
- platform: buienradar
    latitude: 51.65
    longitude: 5.70
    monitored_conditions:
      - stationname
      - symbol
      - humidity
      - temperature
      - groundtemperature
      - windspeed
      - windforce
      - winddirection
      - windazimuth
      - pressure
      - visibility
      - windgust
      - precipitation
      - irradiance
      - precipitation_forecast_average
      - precipitation_forecast_total
```
